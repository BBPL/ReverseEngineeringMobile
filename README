## Top Android Application Security Risks

1. Hard-coded secrets

   Through out the project we have noticed a lot of application, have hard-coded secret in their applications.

   Secrets such as API-keys for backend, Twitter tokens, Google tokens.

2. Data integrity

   The Backend not being thoroughly tested, having flaws and thus allowing to misuse the application.

3. Enumeration attack

   Weak hashing of passwords client-side, and no login restrictions on the back-end
